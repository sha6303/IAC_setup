Creating an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template from scratch for building and deploying a database/data-warehouse server on AWS using AWS CloudFormation can be a complex task, but I can provide you with a simplified example. In this example, we'll create an AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) instance and an EC2 instance to host Apache Airflow. Additionally, we'll use AWS S3 to simulate data ingestion into the database. CloudFormation YAML template is configured in setup.yaml file.
In this template:
Parameters: You can customize the database name, username, password, and EC2 instance type as input parameters.
Resources:
RDSDatabase: Creates an RDS MySQL instance.
AirflowInstance: Launches an EC2 instance for Airflow.
AirflowSecurityGroup: Defines a security group allowing SSH and HTTP access to the EC2 instance.
UserData in AirflowInstance: This section runs a script during EC2 instance initialization. In this script, you can download and execute your Airflow setup scripts from an S3 bucket. Be sure to replace 'your-airflow-scripts-bucket' with the actual S3 bucket containing your Airflow setup scripts.
Outputs: Exposes the RDS endpoint and the public IP address of the Airflow EC2 instance.
